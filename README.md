This repository is my personal solution to daily coding challenges I am tackling. 

I hope to be able to do this daily for as long as I can.

Each solution will be in a self contained class. But where necessary, a package will be created to hold 
all the classes of a solution so viewers can easily run the programs for testability.

I would also welcome code critique.

Thank you.
